# 9 Sorting Algorithms

It was a coding assignment given under the Bachelors course **Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms** in Spring 2015


Following sorting algorithms were implemented:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
   - Top Down
   - Bottom Up
5. Quick Sort
   - Simple Partition
   - Hoare Partition
6. Heap Sort
7. Count Sort
8. Radix Sort
9. Shell Sort

Besides just running the sorting algorithms, the program also performs comparison of two algorithms. The algorithm takes the following options a sinput:

1. Select two algorithms for comparison
2. Total data size
3. Data range
   - Starting value
   - Ending value
4. Initial data size to start with
5. Number of times the process be repeated (to take avg.)
